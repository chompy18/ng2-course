White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power in this world.

    "summary": "<p><strong>Bad Universe</strong> is a television series on the Discovery Channel that attempts to explain some of the phenomena in the universe, while demystifying those that are harder to prove. The show is hosted by Phil Plait, an American astronomer who has spend much of his career dispelling misconceptions about the physical world. His show Bad Universe takes this commitment to universal truth to new levels. Throughout the episodes, Plait goes to tasks against what he calls \"bad science,\" debunking false claims that get passed around as scientific truths about astronomy. Much like Mythbusters, much of the things Plait tries to demystify is the type of science you see in blockbuster Hollywood movies. Asteroid apocalypses, among other cataclysmic scenarios, are played out and scrutinized for their legitimacy. In addition to letting you know whether or not the event is plausible, Plait proposes a few ways to prevent them for happening, or at least mitigating their overall destructiveness.</p>",
